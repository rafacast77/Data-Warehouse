# Data-Warehouse :file_cabinet:
This repository contains the dataset, Excel pivot tables and star schema, and also the report from the Data Warehouse projects I have undergone at Robert Gordon University.  I learned all stages of a data warehouse life-cycle (Planning, building and exploiting). Learned about OLAP and ETL processes.

## Technologies and techniques used for this project

### In-memory data modelling, ETL and analysis with Excel
   
* Microsoft Power BI
*	Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX)
* Identified and explained main concepts and components of data warehouse
* Designed, analyse and applied methodologies for designing a data warehousing applications and OLAP.
* Used Excel and DAX to answer BI questions from the warehouse database I created.

### Data modelling SSIS and data analysis with SSAS
* Microsoft SQL Server,Â SQL and Transact-SQL
* Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and MDX
* Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
* Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Using Microsoft SQL server I implemented a star schema to store the database
* Implemented the ETL process using SSIS with Microsoft Visual Studio and loaded it to the previously created data warehouse.
* Using Microsoft Visual Studio I created an SSAS project and built a cube and set dimensions related to the data on the warehouse.
* Implemented MDX queries in SQL Server Management Studio and produces different analysis.
